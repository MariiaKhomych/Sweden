                        <h1>Geographic data</h1>
                        <p>Sweden (full name: Konungariket Sverige or Kingdom of Sweden) is the biggest country in Scandinavia, covering an area of 450,000 sq km. It borders Finland to its northeast and Norway to its west. The dominant characteristics of the landscape can be attributed to glacial activity. The 7000 km-long (4330mi) coastline, particularly in the west and near Stockholm, is constantly cut by fjords (long, narrow sea inlets). There are about 100,000 lakes in Sweden. The islands of Öland and Gotland, south of Stockholm, consist of flat limestone, but they're sand-fringed and have been turned into beachy retreats for urban escapees. Norrland (a practical term for the northern 60% of the country) is sparsely populated, comprising a near uniform expanse of forest, river and rapid. Norway provides a natural frontier to the west on the other side of Skanderna, Sweden's modest mountain range. Sweden's highest peak is the glacier-capped northern peak of Mt. Kebnekaise at 2111m (6924ft).
The south and southwest of the country are gently undulating, picturesque holiday lands, and fringed with some of Europe's finest beaches. The west coast harbours a host of historic ports – Gothenburg, Helsingborg and Malmö, which is now linked by bridge to Copenhagen – while off the southeast coast, the Baltic islands of Öland and Gotland are the country's most hyped resorts, supporting a lazy beach-life to match that of the best southern European spots but without the hotel blocks and crowds.
Stockholm, the capital, is the country's supreme attraction, a bundle of islands housing monumental architecture, fine museums and the country's most active culture and nightlife.</p>

    <h1>Population</h1>
    <p>Sweden has almost 9 million inhabitants. About 600,000 people are foreigner, of whom a third Finnish.
Sweden has one of the lowest population densities in Europe, with an average of 20 people per sq. km. But there are great regional differences: in the utmost north the density is only 3 people per sq. km., whereas this number is 250 in and around Stockholm. One third of he population lives in the urban areas of Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö. Sweden is divided into 24 provinces and has 280 municipalities. The capital of Sweden is Stockholm, where one million and a half people live (including suburbs). The other big cities in Sweden are Goteborg, Malmö, Uppsala, Norrkoping and Orebro. Cities in the north rarely have more than 20.000 inhabitants.
The only native minority in Sweden are the 15.000 Sami (indigenous Lapp inhabitants) in the north, who differ from the other Swedes both in body characteristics as in language and culture. Since the prehistory the Sami live in the north of Sweden.
The average life expectancy for men in Sweden is 75 years and for women 81 years.
1 million Swedes emigrated at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, most of them to the USA.</p>

    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>Swedish is a Germanic language, belonging to the Nordic branch, and is spoken throughout Sweden and in parts of Finland. Swedes, Danes and Norwegians can, however, make themselves mutually understood since their languages are similar. Most Swedes speak English as a second language. In the north the Samen still have five Samish dialects.</p>

    <h1>Economy</h1>
    <p>Sweden is a strongly industrialized Western nation with a free enterprise economy. Several of its companies enjoy a worldwide reputation, and names like Ericsson, Volvo and Astra stand for high quality and state-of-the-art products. The industry is based both on rich mineral resources, vast forests, and a number of Swedish inventions by the turn of the century. Sweden is one of the worlds leading exporters of iron ore and forest products (paper pulp and paper). Highquality steel is another Swedish speciality.

<br>Forestry<br>
The Swedish forest industry has played an important part in the Swedish economy since the middle of the 19th century. It has over the years become mainly export-oriented and accounted for almost half of Swedish exports during the 1950s. Swedish forestry is considered very modern and it operates with long-term ecological objectives.

<br>Mining industry</br>
The mining industry is dominated by the LKAB company and 90% of its production is exported, mainly to the German steel industry. The exports of iron ore have decreased since the mid 1970s but Sweden is still among the top ten exporters in the world. The steel industry is also exporting most of its production. Swedish steel producers have concentrated on quality and more than half of the sales value consists of the more expensive special steel used for precision tools and ball bearings, etc.

<br>Production</br>
The engineering industry is the largest manufacturing industry in Sweden. The industry has a very high technological level. Swedish engineering companies like SKF, ABB and Ericsson and inventions like the ball bearing have given Sweden a good worldwide reputation in this sector. The car and airplane industries are also significant. Volvo and SAAB are well-known companies in these fields and produce both cars and trucks under various brand names. SAAB is also a producer of commercial and military airplanes. Many traditional Swedish mechanical manufacturing companies have diversified into the electronics industry, which has grown rapidly. Sweden has one of the most automatized manufacturing industries in the world, and Sweden's ABB is the largest producer of industrial robots in Europe.

<br>The Service Industry</br>
The service sector is by far the largest in the Swedish economy in terms of employment. It consists not only of traditional services like financial, educational and medical but also of an increasing service part in production industries. Large parts of the Swedish service industry belong to the public sector, for instance are almost all hospitals, schools and child care centers owned by the State. A privatization process has started in this sector and former monopolies like Posten (mail services), Telia (telecommunications) and SJ (railway transports) have been or are in the process of being introduced on the stock market.

<br>The Chemical Industry</br>
Chemical products have been manufactured in Sweden for over a hundred years. The Swedish chemical industry was in the beginning mainly producing matches and explosives, while paint and plastics have grown to become a large share of chemical production after World War II. The medical part, dominated by Astra and Pharmacia & Upjohn, is the most research intensive of all industries and its products have been very successful during the last decades.</p>

    <h1>Tourism</h1>
    <p>Many visitors heading for history- and monument-rich France or Italy mistakenly think Sweden lacks attractions. This is not the case. While many people with Italian citizenship by descent travel to Italy because of the ease of their dual citizenship, it is certainly worth their time to visit other historic countries like Sweden. Sweden possesses 1,140 historic fortresses, 2,500 open-air runic stones, 25,000 protected Iron Age graveyards, and 10 royal castles around the Stockholm area alone. Stockholm is the centre of cultural life, which attracts most visitors. Ystad and Båstad are well-known seaside resorts. The island Gotland and Öland in the Baltic Sea are popular destinations because of their mild climate and subtropical vegetation.
Every year about 6 million people visit Sweden.</p>
